| HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN SCENE |
|______________________________|

We will present how to format your .ini file.

[This_is_a_scope]
parameter1=0
parameter2=0.1,0.5,200.0
parameter3="FooFoo", "BarBar"

This is an example of a scope. Each parameter has 1 or more index.
The data type is not important, but has to be valid.
(ex: if we wait a number, "Hello" is not valid...)


The color parameters use hexadecimal notation:
0xAABBGGRR or 0xBBGGRR
(A -> Alpha | B -> Blue | G -> Green | R -> Red)

The position/direction parameters are points in space or 3D vectors:
x,y,z

Rotation has the same notation (x,y,z) but is different:
It's the rotation angle applied on axis x, y, and z for that object, in this precise order.
Those angles are in degree.


The scopes:

[scene]
width=1920
height=1080
background_color=0xFF00AA

If you use this scope, the name should always be "scene".
The parameters are all optionnals, if you don't use it, default values will be used.


[camera]
position=-5.0,0.1,0.3
direction=0,0,0
focale=0.1
fov=90

If you use this scope, the name should always be "scene".
The parameters are all optionnals, if you don't use it, default values will be used.


[mat_glass]
color=0xFF00AA
opacity=0.3
reflectivity=0.4
fresnel=0.8

This is a material. The name should always begin with "mat_".
They will be applied on the objects. Those are visual properties.
You can have more than one material.
The parameters are all optionnals, if you don't use it, default values will be used.


[obj_1]
type=sphere
position=0,0,0
rotation=0,0,0
material=mat_glass

This is an object. The name should always begin with "obj_".
You can choose the type between [sphere | plane | cylinder | cone].
You can also choose the material with his scope name.
The parameters are all optionnals, if you don't use it, default values will be used.


[light_1]
type=spot
position=0,3,5
direction=3,2.5,1
color=0xFFFF00
radius=0.5
power=10

This is a light. The name should always begin with "light_".
You can choose the type between [point | directionnal | spot].
The parameters are all optionnals, if you don't use it, default values will be used.
